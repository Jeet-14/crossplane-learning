## Day 5

--

-We can import existing object into cp either manual method or automatic import.

-Have created s3 bucket using console, have imported it [manually](./manual-import-s3-bucket.yaml)

Prob:

1. Tags were overwrite by importing
2. Have suspended Versioning property but cp does not detect or revert it
3. Deleted tags from console but cp does not detect changes.
